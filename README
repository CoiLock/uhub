Welcome and thanks for downloading uHub.
See the COPYING file for licensing details (GPLv3).


SUPPORTED PLATFORMS AND PREREQUISITES

Getting started should be fairly straight forward if you are
on Linux, BSD or MacOSX.

In any case you will need GNU make for compiling uHub.
The makefiles depends on Perl for autodetect the endianess of the
host system, but this can be worked around by specifying
BIGENDIAN=YES or NO as a parameter for make (default is AUTO).

uHub requires libevent to be installed, you can download libevent
from http://monkey.org/~provos/libevent/ if you do not already
have it.

On Windows you will need MinGW in order to compile, and you might
have to use (make CC=gcc).


COMPILING

- run "make"

Make sure you have GNU make. On some systems, such as FreeBSD,
you have to run "gmake" instead of the traditional BSD make.


INSTALLING

Either run "make install", or:

- create the directory /etc/uhub
- copy ./doc/uhub.conf to /etc/uhub
- copy ./doc/users.conf to /etc/uhub

You should now be able to start the hub (using: ./uhub).


CONFIGURATION

To see help, use ./uhub -h

The default configuration file is fairly straight forward
and will explain roughly what all the different configuration
directive does.

When you have reconfigured the hub, you don't have to restart
it, but rather send a 'HUP' signal to the server, and it will 
reload the configuration files, user database and message
of the day (motd).

Use: "kill -HUP {pid of uhub}", or "killall -HUP uhub".


REPORTING PROBLEMS

Send bugs reports, questions, feature requests, etc. to our
e-mail address: < uhub (at) extatic (dot) org >

However, see the file 'BUGS' for a list of known bugs.
